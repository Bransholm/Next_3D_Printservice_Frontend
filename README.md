# Welcome to the "3D Printservice" Frontend Repository! ðŸ‘‹

Hello and thank you for dropping by! You've landed in the digital home of our frontend application for our exam project: the "3D Printservice."

This is a web-shop, offering a wide range of 3D-printed products right at your fingertips. So if you like 3D-prints, you've come to the right place.

This is our first attempt at creating a web-shop application from scratch.

We're glad to have you here, feel free to dive in and discover what our frontend application "3D Printservice" has to offer!

# Introduction

This is our frontend repository for our 2nd semester exam project. The exam project requires the students to contact a business and create web-based application as a functional solution which would either fill a gap where they needed a web based solution, or help make an existing solution better.

We are TEAM10, a trio composed of the following members;

- **[Kenneth Bransholm Schou](https://github.com/Bransholm)**
- **[Lukas Aleksander Maibom](https://github.com/luma0001)**
- **[Thomas Gorm Neermark](https://github.com/Gorm-git)**

We ended up getting into contact with a startup buisness "3D-Printservice. With an entrepreneur minded PO dreaming about starting his own company based around selling 3D-printed products on their own web-shop.
Lacking experience and knowledge of how to make said web-shop, but full of ideas about different functionalities they figured would make a stable fundament for a web-shop. After discussing what we would or wouldn't be able to make, we ended up agreeing to try our best to create a fullstack solution, where we would try our best to make a 3D-webshop from the ground up.

**Let's dive in.**

## Conclusion & Contribution

### 1. Conclusion

We aimed to create a our data structure based off of the principles of the MVC software design pattern. While some functionalities might have been placed incorrect, we've been able to make a somewhat coherent program logic.

**This project was made by created in collaboration by Kenneth Brandsholm Schou, Lukas Aleksander Maibom & Thomas Gorm Neermark**
